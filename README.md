# DSA with C#
This repository contains my complete **Data Structures & Algorithms preparation in C#**, built with the goal of cracking interviews at top product-based companies.

It is not just a collection of solutions, but a **structured, disciplined, and interview-focused learning system** where every problem is documented with:
- Clear approach
- Time and space complexity
- Identified pattern
- Clean and readable C# code

## 🎯 Objective

To build strong problem-solving skills, pattern recognition, and explanation ability required for backend and software engineering interviews.

This repository demonstrates:
- Daily consistency
- Structured preparation
- Growth in problem-solving depth
- Professional coding practices

## 🧠 How I Practice

For every DSA topic:
- Minimum **3 days per topic**
- Every day I solve:
  - 2 Easy problem  
  - 2 Medium problem  
  - 1 Hard problem  

Each solution includes:
- Problem description  
- Approach explanation  
- Time & Space complexity  
- Pattern used

Each topic folder contains individual `.cs` files for the problems solved in that category.

## 📝 Code Format Standard

Each problem file follows this structure:

```csharp
/*
Problem: <Problem Name>
Difficulty: Easy / Medium / Hard

Approach:
Explain the idea clearly.

Time Complexity: O(...)
Space Complexity: O(...)

Pattern: HashMap / Two Pointer / Sliding Window / DP / etc.
