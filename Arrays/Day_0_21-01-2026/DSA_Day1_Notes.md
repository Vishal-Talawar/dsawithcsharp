\## Day 0

Problems Solved:

\- Two Sum (Easy) → HashMap / Complement lookup

\- Maximum Subarray (Medium) → Kadane’s Algorithm

\- Longest Common Prefix → Prefix Shrinking

\- Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array → Two Pointer / In-place array update

\- Container With Most Water → Two Pointer + Greedy

\- First Missing Positive → Index Mapping (Cyclic Sort idea)
